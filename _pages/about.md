I am a PhD candidate in the<a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/"> Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences </a>, at University of Massachusetts, Amherst (UMass), working with <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/fiterau-brostean-ina"> Dr. Madalina Fiterau</a> in the <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/infofusion/home/"> InFusion lab</a>. Prior to UMass, I worked as a software engineer at IBM Research Africa in Nairobi, Kenya. I acquired my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Nairobi, Kenya. The full list of my education and work experiences are on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ymeYDMoblZlYs1-QLbZQivydXY3MOLcs/view?usp=drive_link"> my CV</a>.

My research is at the intersection of Data Science and Healthcare. Specifically, I leverage Statistics and Machine Learning to improve health equity. To this end, I build systems that:

  - automatically extract comparable cohorts from multiple electronic health record datasets
  - determine whether there are statistically significant differences in treatment of those cohorts
  - attempt to generalize any differences across multiple datasets
  - integrate social determinants of health with a twofold goal: to improve prediction performance, and, to personalize models to patient subgroups
